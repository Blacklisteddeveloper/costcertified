			<h2>CostCertified™ was born out of a strong need in the marketplace for contractors to be able to provide real-time, consistent, reliable and accurate quotes for all jobs both large and small.</h2>
			<p>In order for any construction or renovation company to grow they need to find a way to accurately quote jobs.</p>
			<p>Not having a great system in place can cost the company time and money. Not to mention, poorly estimated jobs can result in unhappy customers. CostCertified™ is more than just a software tool.</p>
			<p>It is a new industry standard whereby the contractor or construction company is CostCertified™ meaning they have been trained and approved to use the CostCertified™ quoting app and bear our seal of approval on all quotes/estimates.</p>

			<h3>The Story of CostCertified™</h3>
			<h2>About US</h2>
			<ul class="time">
				<li>
					<h3>3 Years Ago </h3>
					<p>Our vision is to create an easy-to-use quoting tool for contractors, sales people, estimators, renovators, insurance adjusters, homeowners, and bankers that provides real-time, accurate quotes no matter how big or small the project.</p>
					<p>Too many projects are misquoted or poorly estimated leaving the homeowner with a bad taste and the company struggling to make a profit. It's time for something like CostCertified™ that brings an industry standard where both homeowner and business owner alike are confident in </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>1 Year Ago </h3>
					<p>CostCertified™ is now becoming a recognizable brand in Canada.</p>
					<p>The vision of the company is that every household in Canada and the United States will soon request that their contractor be CostCertified™.</p>
					<p>And it only makes sense that all contractors or service providers will want to use the CostCertified™ app since it provides instant, accurate quotes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Today </h3>
					<p>After the owners of the renovation company found the right partners they went to work developing the CostCertified™ app.</p>
					<p>It took over a year of development since everyone involved wanted to ensure it was easy-to-use but still very robust. The app is built using new technology and is iPad friendly.</p>
