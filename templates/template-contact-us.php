			<h2>CostCertified™ was born out of a strong need in the marketplace for contractors to be able to provide real-time, consistent, reliable and accurate quotes for all jobs both large and small.</h2>
			<p>In order for any construction or renovation company to grow they need to find a way to accurately quote jobs.</p>
			<p>Not having a great system in place can cost the company time and money. Not to mention, poorly estimated jobs can result in unhappy customers. CostCertified™ is more than just a software tool.</p>
			<p>It is a new industry standard whereby the contractor or construction company is CostCertified™ meaning they have been trained and approved to use the CostCertified™ quoting app and bear our seal of approval on all quotes/estimates.</p>
